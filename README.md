- You may have noticed that the wireframes look quite a bit different than the finished site. This is due to my scope and MVP changing as development continued. The most glaring difference is the footer. I decided to use a minimalistic footer simply because I believe it fits the site better. You may have also noticed the lack of an About page. This is because I didn't see the need for an About page. Instead, I chose to have a Blog Post created by an Admin account act as one. I figured this was better for the user experience whilst also aligning with the sites purpose.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories and files:

- `account/`: Manages user accounts, including models, views, and admin configurations.
- `forum/`: Handles forum-related functionalities such as forms, views, and templates.
- `git_comet/`: The main Django application configuration, including settings and URLs.
- `static/` and `staticfiles/`: Contains static assets like CSS and JavaScript files.
- `templates/`: Stores HTML templates for rendering views.
- `manage.py`: A command-line utility for administrative tasks.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for the project.
- `Procfile`: Specifies the commands to run the application on Heroku.
- `README.md`: You're reading this right now. Hello! ðŸ‘‹

## Technologies Used

- **Django**
- **Heroku**
- **Gitpod**
- **Code Institute Template**
- **Code Institute Database**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Copilot**

## Features Implemented

1. **User Authentication**: Not done quite yet. Hopefully on the next commit.
2. **Forum**: Created a forum where users can post topics and will eventually be able to comment on posts.
3. **Admin Interface**: Customized the Django admin interface to manage user accounts and forum posts.
4. **Static Files Management**: Configured the handling of static files.
5. **Deployment**: Set up deployment configurations for Heroku, such as the `Procfile`, `runtime.txt`, and numerous Heroku config vars that I will detail on a later commit as I can't sign into Heroku, reason being, Google Authenticator decided it's going to feed me incorrect codes. Thanks Google.
6. **Ratings**: Implemented a rating system that allows users to rate posts. This feature strengthens community engagement and encourages users to create accounts.
7. **Draft and Update Posts**: Added the ability for users to save drafts and update their posts. This feature allows users to refine their content before publishing and keep their posts up-to-date.
8. **Profile Picture**: Enabled users to choose from a selection of three profile pictures. This feature provides users with an extra bit of customization.
9. **Bio**: Added a bio feature that allows users to create and update a personal biography on their profile. This adds a personal touch to user profiles and helps build a sense of community.
10. **Contact Us**: Created a Contact Us page that provides users with a way to reach out to the site administrators for support, feedback, or inquiries. This feature is essential for maintaining open communication with the user base.

### Purpose Behind Features

- **User Authentication**: The purpose of adding user authentication is to ensure that users can securely log in and manage their accounts. It was essential that users were given the option to change their username, email address, and password. This feature also lays the groundwork for future enhancements, such as personalized content and user-specific settings.
- **Forum**: The main forum allows users to create and participate in discussions. This is the core functionality of Git Comet, enabling coders to ask questions, share knowledge, and connect with others in the community. The forum allows for signed-in users to make posts of their own, or rate and comment on other users' posts. This interaction fosters a collaborative environment where users can learn from each other and build professional relationships.
- **Ratings**: Ratings synergize extremely well with the main forum page. When this site was just an idea, a rating system was my favorite feature. The reason behind this, not only to strengthen community engagement and further encourage users to create accounts, but also because it was the first time I had ever attempted something of the sort. Ratings help highlight valuable content and give users a sense of accomplishment when their posts are well-received.
- **Admin Interface**: Customizing the Django admin interface helps administrators manage user accounts and forum posts more efficiently. It provides a user-friendly way to oversee the site's content and user interactions. This is required for any social platform to ensure that the community guidelines are followed and to manage any inappropriate content or user behavior.
- **Profile Picture**: A signed-in user can choose from a selection of three profile pictures. Profile pictures provide users with that extra bit of customization that was my goal for Git Comet. This feature helps users express their individuality and makes the platform feel more personalized.
- **Draft and Update Posts**: The ability to save drafts and update posts allows users to work on their posts over time and make changes as needed. This feature ensures that users can refine their content before publishing and keep their posts up-to-date with new information. It also reduces the pressure on users to finalize their posts in one sitting, leading to higher quality content.
- **Contact Us**: The Contact Us page provides users with a way to reach out to the site administrators for support, feedback, or inquiries. This feature is essential for maintaining open communication with the user base and addressing any issues or suggestions they may have. It helps build trust and shows that the administrators are approachable and responsive to user needs.
- **Bio**: The Bio feature allows users to create and update a personal biography on their profile. This adds a personal touch to user profiles and helps build a sense of community by allowing users to share more about themselves. It encourages users to connect on a more personal level and fosters a sense of belonging within the community.

## How I've Used Copilot

GitHub Copilot has been an invaluable tool throughout the development of Git Comet. However, on many occassions, Copilot has provided me with incorrect code, used techniques I'm not familiar with, and many more small issues. Despite this, I've used Copilot to great effect. Here are some of the ways Copilot has assisted me in building this project.

1. **Code Suggestions**: Copilot has provided code suggestions, helping me write code faster. It has been particularly useful for generating boilerplate code, repetitive tasks, and project wide changes (such as renaming a file).
2. **Documentation**: Copilot has assisted in writing this readme file. I wrote the content, whilst Copilot formatted it so that it doesn't look like a lunatics notepad document. Copilot has also provided me with very useful and surprisingly accurate commit messages. If only it was this accurate with its code.
3. **Debugging**: By suggesting potential fixes and improvements, Copilot has helped me debug issues more efficiently. It has provided insights into best practices and alternative approaches to solving problems.
4. **Learning**: Copilot has served as a learning tool, offering explanations and examples for various coding concepts and libraries. This has been especially helpful when working with new technologies or unfamiliar code it would often try to use.

Overall, GitHub Copilot has significantly enhanced my productivity and in some cases, the quality of my code. It has been like having an exceptionally smart (but also arrogant) person to talk to. Although it has been adamant I add code which clearly will not work, it's tried its best.

## Deployment

- **Hosting Platform**: The project is hosted on **Heroku**, a cloud platform that simplifies deployment and scaling of web applications. The deployment process involves pushing the code to a Heroku Git repository, which triggers an automatic build and deployment pipeline.

- **Environment Variables**: The project relies on several environment variables for secure configuration. These include:
  - `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key used by Django for cryptographic signing.
  - `DATABASE_URL`: The URL for the PostgreSQL database used in production.
  - `DEBUG`: A boolean flag to toggle debug mode.
  - `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: A list of allowed hosts for the application.
  - `CLOUDINARY_URL`: The URL for Cloudinary, used for managing static and media files.

- **Static and Media Files**: 
  - Static files are managed using **WhiteNoise**, which allows serving static files directly from the Heroku server.
  - Media files are stored and served using **Cloudinary**, a cloud-based media management service.

- **Buildpacks**: The following buildpacks are used for deployment:
  - `heroku/python`: For running the Django application.
  - `heroku/nodejs`: For managing frontend dependencies and building static assets.

- **Procfile**: The `Procfile` specifies the commands to run the application on Heroku. It includes:
  ```plaintext
  web: gunicorn git_comet.wsgi --log-file -
  ```

- **Cloning the Original Repository**:  
  During the development process, I cloned the original Git Comet repository from [Git Comet Repository](https://github.com/Ronan525/Git-Comet). This was done to ensure that I had a local copy of the project for further development, testing, and customization. Cloning the repository allowed me to work on the project offline, experiment with new features, and make changes without affecting the live version of the site. It also provided a backup of the original codebase, ensuring that I could revert to a stable version if needed. The cloning process was performed using the following command:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Ronan525/Git-Comet.git
  ```

### Lighthouse Scores

- **Lighthouse**: My first lighthouse test was extremely motivating. For mobile, I had a performance score of 92, accessibility score of 82, Best Practices score of 100, and an SEO score of 91. The desktop score was identical aside from performance which was at 98. I'm very happy with these results. Eventually, I began experimenting with further optimisations to increase site performance for mobile and desktop devices. Copilot suggested that I create two new JavaScript files, one for Critical JS, and the other for Non Critical JS. It also reccomended that I move critical CSS into base.html. After applying these, I deployed the site and tested it again, only to discover the sites JavaScript, certain CSS elements, and certain pages were completely broken. The only positive was a 1% improvement in desktop performance. For such a miniscule performance gain, I decided against applying these changes, and reverted to a previous version. The test at 4:52PM is test 1, and the test at 5:10PM/5:11PM is test 2.

<div style="text-align: center;">

    <img src="static/images/lighthouse-test2.png" alt="Lighthouse Test 1 Desktop" style="max-width: 30%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="static/images/lighthouse-test1d.png" alt="Lighthouse Test 2 Mobile" style="max-width: 32%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
    <img src="static/images/lighthouse-test2d.png" alt="Lighthouse Test 2 Deskstop" style="max-width: 31.5%; height: 40; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
</div>

- In response to the high, but still not satisfactory accessibility score of 82, I made further improvements to the site. The two largest issues the lighthouse test had regarding my sites accessibility was the colour of some text elements, it was deemed too similar to the background, hence unreadable. However, I have tested this myself using multiple people, viewing the site on two of the most common display types, OLED, and LCD. The purpose of this was to see if this was an issue that an actual living breathing human being might encounter. Once I had finished my little experiment using family and friends as guinea pigs, I came to the conclusion that the text was visible on all display types in every condition aside from LCD displays whilst outside. Despite this being a minority, I decided to change the text colour anyway, as despite the very particular conditions, it was still an issue that would effect a portion of the user base. This improved the sites accessibility score massively. It now rests at a score of 95.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="static/images/lighthouse-test3.png" alt="Lighthouse Test 3 Mobile" style="max-width: 31%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
    <img src="static/images/lighthouse-test3d.png" alt="Lighthouse Test 3 Desktop" style="max-width: 31.4%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
</div>

- Although the mobile performance score dropped by 2, I am more than comfortable sacrificing such a small amount of performance in favour for a more accessible and responsive site. Overall, I'm immensely impressed with these scores.

### W3C Validation

- **W3C HTML Validation**: Throughout development, I had consciously been optimising my code ensuring that it was valid HTML5. Due to this, when it came time to do my first W3C validation test, I only had two errors, both on different sites. One error was seemingly a Heroku error (surprise surprise) as the validator could not connect to the page. The second error is seemingly unavoidable,as from what I can tell, the validator itself is incorrect. The error claims that there's _No p element in scope but a p end tag seen_, yet when checking the page source code at the line and column listed, this issue isn't present. The CSS validation returned with no errors, so no adjustments were made.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="static/images/validation-error1.png" alt="Lighthouse Test 3 Mobile" style="max-width: 21%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
    <img src="static/images/validation-error2.png" alt="Lighthouse Test 3 Desktop" style="max-width: 42.075%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="static/images/W3C-CSS-validation.png" alt="Successful CSS validation" style="max-width: 40%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
</div>

- Despite these frustrations, I'm extremely happy with both the Lighthouse Scores, and the W3C Validation.

### Major Issues

- **Heroku**: The amount of issues I had deploying to Heroku is incredible. I must have jinxed myself early on in development as I had seen my colleagues have constant issues with Heroku, while I was sat there thinking "Oh god. Something bad is going to happen any minute now and it'll take ages to fix." and as I expected. It happened. To be completely honest, I have no idea what issue Heroku had with my project. I was getting errors relating to code which was 200% correct and working, whilst intentionally sabotaged code wasn't even mentioned in the error logs. Where my local server ran, the Heroku server crashed and burned, then flipped over, and exploded. With Heroku Test Deployment 10, the site began working again. I have no idea why. My best guess is Heroku servers operate under the "If it ain't broke, find an excuse as to why it's broke" philosophy

- **Profile Pictures**: Originally, my idea for Git Comet users to change their profile picture allowed users to upload custom images from their local machine to the site. However, I soon discovered that this was easier said than done, as not only was the implementation of this feature causing issues with HTML validation and site performances, but the JavaScript needed for a drag and drop system was proving to be time consuming and incompatible with many site elements. There was also the issue with accessibility, as the dropdown menu, one of the core functions of Git Comet, may blend into the background too well if the uploaded image was too similar to the sites colour scheme. Due to this, I altered the idea and settled on a preset list of profile pictures a signed in user can choose between.

- **Storm Eowyn**: Due to Storm Eowyn, I had lost internet all day January 25th, preventing me from commiting work I had completed that day. This caused me to lose a fair amount of work. In total, I had lost: 

- Additions to the README.md
- Accessibility improvements
- Performance improvements
- Account automated tests
- Post content bug fix

## Testing

### Automated Testing

During development, I created multiple `tests.py` files to ensure the functionality of the site. These files contain classes that test various models, forms, views, and URLs across the `Forum` and `Comet` apps. Below is a detailed breakdown of the automated tests and how they helped me troubleshoot issues:

#### **Models**
- **Posts**: Verified that posts are created correctly, slugs are generated properly, and the string representation matches the title.
- **Comments**: Ensured comments are linked to the correct post, have the correct default values (e.g., `approved_comment` is `False`), and the string representation matches the comment content.
- **User Profiles**: Tested that user profiles are created with the correct attributes, including the profile picture and bio.

#### **Forms**
- **CommentForm**: Validated that the form accepts valid data (e.g., non-empty content) and rejects invalid data (e.g., empty content).
- **UserProfileForm**: Ensured the form validates correctly when all required fields are provided, including `username`, `email`, and `profile_picture`. 
  - **Error Encountered**: The `test_valid_user_profile_form` initially failed because the `profile_picture` field did not match one of the predefined choices in the form. 
  - **Solution**: Updated the test data to include a valid `profile_picture` value from the predefined choices in the form.

#### **Views**
- **Post Views**: Tested that the `PostListView` and `PostDetailView` resolve correctly and return the expected templates.
- **Profile View**: Verified that the profile update view handles both GET and POST requests correctly.
  - **Error Encountered**: The `test_update_profile_view_post` initially failed with a 405 error because the view did not handle POST requests.
  - **Solution**: Updated the `profile` view to handle POST requests and save the updated user profile data.

#### **URLs**
- Ensured that all key URLs resolve to the correct views, including:
  - `forum-home` â†’ `PostListView`
  - `post-detail` â†’ `PostDetailView`
  - `profile` â†’ `profile`
  - **Error Encountered**: The `test_update_profile_url_resolves` initially failed because the `profile` URL was not defined.
  - **Solution**: Added the `profile` URL to the `comet/urls.py` file and mapped it to the `profile` view.

#### **General Observations**
- The tests were run using the `python manage.py test` command.
- **Initial Errors**: Some tests failed due to missing or incorrect data in the test setup. For example:
  - Missing required fields in forms.
  - Incorrect URL mappings.
  - Views not handling specific HTTP methods.
- **Solutions**: These issues were resolved by:
  - Updating test data to include all required fields.
  - Adding missing URL patterns.
  - Modifying views to handle the necessary HTTP methods.

#### **Final Results**
After resolving the errors, all tests passed successfully. This ensured that the core functionality of the site, including models, forms, views, and URLs, worked as expected.

---

### Manual Testing

Throughout development, I conducted extensive manual testing to ensure the site functioned as intended. This involved testing various features, layouts, and interactions across different devices and browsers. Below is a detailed breakdown of the manual testing process:

#### **JavaScript Functions**

  **Dropdown Menus**
- **Expected**: Clicking the dropdown menu icon causes a menu to open vertically.
- **Testing**: Clicked the dropdown menu icon on both Desktop and Mobile.
- **Result**: Dropdown menu opened horizontally.
- **Fix**: Make small adjustments to the CSS properties `padding` and `text-align`. 

  **Submit Button on Contact Us Form**
- **Expected**: Clicking the submit button should send the form data and display a success message.
- **Testing**: Filled out the form with valid data and clicked the submit button.
- **Result**: The form was not submitted.
- **Fix**: Ensured the `ContactUsForm` view correctly handled POST requests.

  **Submit, Create, Draft, Edit, and Delete buttons**
- **Expected**: Clicking X button would trigger Y action.
- **Testing**: Clicked Submit, Create, Draft, Edit, and Delete buttons as both an Admin and regular user.
- **Result**: All the buttons but Draft worked correctly, however, there was a lack of feedback.
- **Fix**: Ensured the `PostPublishView` view correctly handled POST requests.

  **Modals Appearing and Disappearing**
- **Expected**: Modals will appear when triggered and disappear after X amount of time.
- **Testing**: Clear cache, load site and wait for the modal to appear.
- **Result**: Modal functioned correctly a single time. The modal did not reappear unless cache was cleared.
- **Fix**: Added event listeners to `timedModal.js` to ensure the modal appears and disappears correctly.


#### **Testing User Stories and Features**

  **Navigation Links**
- **Expected**: Clicking on a navigation link should redirect the user to the correct page.
- **Testing**: Tested all navigation links by clicking them on the homepage.
- **Result**: All links worked as expected and redirected to the correct pages.
- **Fix**: No fixes were required.

**User Registration**
- **Expected**: A user should be able to register with valid credentials.
- **Testing**: Attempted to register with valid and invalid credentials.
- **Result**: Registration succeeded with valid credentials and failed with invalid credentials, displaying appropriate error messages.
- **Fix**: No fixes were required.

- **Planned Fix**: Investigate alternative methods for implementing custom profile picture uploads.

**User Bios**
- **Issue**: Users cannot view another users Bio page.
- **Impact**: Users are unable to learn more about a specific User, other than what they have posted.
- **Planned Fix**: Investigate methods to display a Bio page as the site does with Posts.

#### **CSS Styling**
- Ensured that CSS was applied correctly across all pages:
  - Verified consistent styling for buttons, links, and text elements. (this was a pain)
  - Checked for proper alignment of elements on both desktop and mobile devices.
  - Ensured that hover effects and transitions worked smoothly.

#### **Posts**
- **Publishing**: Verified that users could successfully publish posts with valid data.
- **Rating**: Tested the rating system to ensure users could upvote and downvote posts.
- **Reading**: Confirmed that posts displayed correctly on the forum page and individual post pages.
- **Deleting**: Ensured that posts could be deleted by their authors and that a success notification appeared.
- **Updating**: Verified that users could edit their posts and that changes were saved correctly.
- **Drafting**: Tested the ability to save posts as drafts and publish them later.

#### **Comments**
- **Posting**: Verified that users could post comments on published posts.
- **Deleting**: Ensured that users could delete their own comments and that a success notification appeared.

#### **Accounts**
- **Creation**: Tested the user registration process to ensure accounts could be created successfully.
- **Editing**: Verified that users could update their profile information, including their bio and profile picture.
- **Authentication**: Ensured that users could log in and log out without issues. This also included the Remember Me option.

#### **Admin Panel**

#### **Links**
- Checked that all links across the site worked correctly and directed users to the intended pages.

#### **Mobile Responsiveness**
- Tested the site on various devices, including a smartphone and tablet, to ensure it was fully responsive.
- Verified that all elements adjusted correctly to different screen sizes and orientations.

#### **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
- Tested the site on multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, and Safari, to ensure consistent functionality and styling.

#### **Accessibility**
- Verified that all pages met accessibility standards:
  - Ensured sufficient color contrast for text and background elements.
  - Checked that all images had descriptive alt text.
  - Tested keyboard navigation to ensure all interactive elements were accessible.
  - Multiple people, all with varying technical abilities, were used for this.

#### **How I Tested**
- **Google DevTools**: Used Google Chrome's developer tools to simulate different devices, screen sizes, and network conditions. This allowed me to identify and fix layout issues, performance bottlenecks, and responsiveness problems. The Network tab was extremely useful for troubleshooting the POST issue which cropped up during automated testing.
- **Mobile Devices**: Loaded the site on physical mobile devices through the Heroku deployment to test real-world performance and usability.
- **Browser Testing**: Manually tested the site on multiple browsers to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.

#### **Issues Identified and Resolved**
- **Dropdown Menus**: Fixed an issue where dropdown menus opened horizontally instead of vertically on mobile devices.
- **Profile Pictures**: Resolved a bug where profile pictures were not displaying correctly after being updated.
- **Form Validation**: Fixed issues with form validation not providing feedback for invalid inputs.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Addressed layout issues on smaller screens, such as misaligned elements and unreadable text.
- **Broken Links**: Corrected several broken links in the navigation bar and footer.
- **JavaScript Errors**: Fixed errors that caused buttons to malfunction on certain pages.

#### **Final Results**
After extensive manual testing and resolving all identified issues, the site is now fully functional, responsive, and accessible. This process ensured that users have a seamless experience across all devices and browsers, despite the ancient ones.
